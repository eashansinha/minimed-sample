# PR Review Log #2

## Summary
- Scope: Add comprehensive translations testing automation framework with CSV-driven workflow, Playwright integration, and documentation
- Risk: Medium (adds new automation tooling but doesn't modify core application code)
- Positives: 
  - Comprehensive documentation and feasibility analysis
  - Well-structured CSV workflow approach
  - Multiple implementation strategies considered
  - Good separation of concerns between automation and orchestration
- Concerns:
  1) Hardcoded file paths break portability (see inline comments)
  2) Placeholder functions make automation non-functional
  3) Missing error handling in critical operations
  4) Environment-specific configurations

## Decision
Request changes.

## Next steps
1) Fix hardcoded file paths to use relative paths
2) Either implement placeholder functions or document MCP integration requirements clearly
3) Add proper error handling for file operations
4) Make configuration environment-agnostic
5) Remove trailing empty lines in CSV file
